# 3D Graphics Engine Project - ONGOING

****Current Capabilities:** rendering obj models through triangle mesh algorithms.

**My objective:** to build a 3D graphics engine with color and texturing capabilities and develop my programming
skill in C++ along the way. I hope to be able to use this project in the future to build 3D games.

## Update #1:
**Wireframe Mountains Demo:**
